# Competitive-Balance
Competitive Balance Indices conducted in R

I use the predefined ratios, which measure the Competitive Balance in European Championships, 
in order to be able to compare the between seasons balance in proportion with the within league competitive balance. 

I have downloaded the data for eight yearsâ€™ time span for specific European championships (2008-09 season to 2015-16 season). 

I aim to compare the measures and find meaningful insights about the competition in the European
football. In addition, I aim to automate the calculation of the metrics for Competitive Balance by creating
easy to use packages in R software (for any user who would be interested in studying the Competitive Balance).
